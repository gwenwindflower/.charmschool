# Deactivated Skills

Skills temporarily disabled but preserved for later reactivation.

## Commands

```bash
skillutil deactivate <skill-name>  # Move skill here
skillutil activate <skill-name>    # Restore to active
```

## Why Deactivate?

- Preserves work without deleting
- Easy re-enable without rebuilding
- Safe experimentation
