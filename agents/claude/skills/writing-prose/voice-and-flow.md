# Voice and Flow

## Avoid - Tier 1

### Binary Contrasts

These create false drama. State the point directly.

| Pattern | Problem |
| --------- | --------- |
| "Not because X. Because Y." | Telegraphed reversal |
| "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is." | Formulaic reframe |
| "The answer isn't X. It's Y." | Predictable pivot |
| "It feels like X. It's actually Y." | Setup/reveal cliche |
| "The question isn't X. It's Y." | Rhetorical misdirection |
| "Not X. But Y." | Mechanical contrast |
| "It's not this. It's that." | Same formula, different words |
| "stops being X and starts being Y" | False transformation arc |

**Instead:** State Y directly. "The problem is Y." "Y matters here."

### Dramatic Fragmentation

Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity.

| Pattern | Problem |
| --------- | --------- |
| "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." | Performative simplicity |
| "X. And Y. And Z." | Staccato drama |
| "This unlocks something. [Word]." | Artificial revelation |

**Instead:** Complete sentences. Trust content over presentation.

### Cliche Relational Phrases

Trying to build a sense of casual intimacy with the reader - "this isn't like those stuffy business articles, I'm a cool writer" - via sassy cliches and slang is never effective or appropriate.

- "Before you know it, X creeps in"
- "You know how it is, ..."
- "X is true, I promise"
- "We're all X these days,..."
- "We're all guilty of X, but"

#### "Real Talk" Rhythm and Tone

A subset of the above, always eliminate the sarcastic, overly direct "no-nonsense" truth-teller tone when you find it.

Some common tells are:

- "Look," used as a setup for some "real talk"
- A lot of rhetorical questions with immediate answers: "Is that what you want? Of course not."
- Setups like "Most people..., but the truth is..." that put assumptions on the reader just to refute them

### Meta-Commentary

Remove self-referential asides:

- "Hint:"
- "Plot twist:" / "Spoiler:"
- "You already know this, but"
- "But that's another post"
- "What I'm trying to say here is"

### Telling the Reader What They Think or Feel

Telling the reader how they feel or what they think:

- "You probably thought that"
- "Now I know what you're thinking, but"
- "Most people think you should X, but"
- "It feels like I'm saying X, but I'm not"

### Rhythms to Avoid

#### Staccato Paragraphs

Avoid paragraphs of _only_ short punchy sentences. For example:

> Ruby is a dynamically typed language. It is foundationally object-oriented. That is, everything is an object. It also has a powerful standard library. Ruby on Rails made it extremely popular for web development. Matz designed Ruby to be a joyful language to write. It has a passionate community.

Direct, punchy writing is good, but it should be balanced with longer sentences and varied rhythm. It is hard to create flow when the sentences all hit with the same length and intensity, and ends up sounding like a list when read aloud.

#### Asides within Asides

The opposite of staccato paragraphs, these are paragraph-sized sentences that quickly become a maze of metaphors, take the following excerpt from a writer with a terrible proclivity for this:

> a movement for social justice, which starts from a fertile vision of the world in which no one is diminished yet falters in its attempts to arrive at such an arrangement by means of calamitous shortcuts -ultimately distorting the centuries-long arc of moral progress as it advances. In ways both obvious and subtle, it is in that warp that fresh injustices fester.

This makes readers' vision fuzz out like a calculus equation. Even if constructed carefully and composed of individually excellent parts (which the above is not), sentences like this are weak. In trying to stack too many ideas together and sustain the flow, they end up breaking it.

#### Subject Last

Here's another doomed sentence structure, a specific type of passive voice structure that lures you in but never works. It can be tempting to create variety by opening a sentence describing something, rather than plainly stating a fact about it. You then realize you need to qualify it with an aside, so you slap in some em dashes. It can sound interesting as you're writing, but using a simple example reveals the obvious flaws: "Australian Shepherds are cute and have a friendly disposition." is a straightforward sentence, "One type of dog that is cute - and possessed of a friendly disposition - is the Australian Shepherd." is a terrible sentence.

Here's a real world example:
> One aspect of centralization with a bad rap — the thing people most point to when extolling the virtues of decentralization — is _process_.

We can still end on 'process', if we want to preserve that, we just need to condense the qualifying information carefully into a direct sentence, not a list of asides. Here's a much better rewrite:
> The marquee issue that proponents of decentralization claim to be eliminating is _process_.

## Rhetorical Setups

These announce insight rather than deliver it.

| Pattern | Problem |
| --------- | --------- |
| "What if [reframe]?" | Socratic posturing |
| "Here's what I mean:" | Redundant preview |
| "Think about it:" | Condescending prompt |
| "And that's okay." | Unnecessary permission |

**Instead:** Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.

## Formulaic Constructions

| Pattern | Problem |
| --------- | --------- |
| "By the time X, I was Y." | Narrative template |
| "X that isn't Y" | Indirect. Say "X is broken" |

## Avoid - Tier 2

### Intra-Sentence Rhythm Patterns

The following are all normal parts of writing, what you're looking for is overuse. If every list is "You can X, Y, and Z," and never "You can X or Y," or every paragraph starts with "So,", it sounds false and sloppy.

| Overuse Pattern | Fix |
| --------- | ----- |
| Three-item lists | Use two items or one |
| Questions answered immediately | Let questions breathe or cut them |
| Paragraphs starting with "So" | Start with content |

### Em Dashes and Asides

Em dashes are fun, and asides are useful, but overuse quickly destroys the flow and rhythm of your writing. If you can split a sentence into multiple sentences, do it. You should only use or preserve asides when they _improve_ the flow of the writing when read aloud. If you're in a patch of short, staccato sentences, a longer sentence with an aside can help add variety and keep the reader engaged.

If you've decided an aside is the right move, always consider whether you should commas, em dashes, or a parenthetical. If the aside is short and tightly connected to the main sentence, commas are usually best. If the aside sounds better with longer pauses around it and more emphasis, or contains a list, em dashes can give it the space it needs to breathe. Parentheticals are best for examples or explanations that add helpful context, but are tangential to the sentence.

**Examples of Good Asides**:

- In a non-technical article: "The website is built with Next.js (a popular JavaScript framework for building web apps) and services millions of users per day."
- "The experience of climbing the mountain, while one of the most challenging things I've ever done, changed my life in ways I could never have achieved otherwise."
- "It's my favorite book - the story, the characters, the magic system - every aspect is deeply immersive and original."

### Word Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
| --------- | --------- |
| Absolute words (always, never, everyone, everybody, nobody) | False authority |
| AI-overused intensifiers (deeply, truly, fundamentally, inherently, simply, literally, inevitably) | Empty emphasis |

### Passive Voice

It's good practice to try rewriting a passive sentence into an active one, it often results in a shorter, clearer sentence with more zip. But, if the actively voiced sentence feels unnatural or awkward, you should keep the original passive phrasing. The same rule applies to ending a sentence with a preposition, or starting a sentence with "And" or "But." You need to try rewording it, but if it sounds worse, don't twist your prose in knots for the sake of dogma.

| Pattern | Problem |
| --------- | --------- |
| "The engineers were overworked by management, and became burnt out." | Describing events in the passive voice |
| "Mistakes were made." | Avoiding responsibility with the passive voice |

"Management overworked the engineers, burning them out."
"We made mistakes."

### Purple Prose

Purple prose is poetic, adjective-rich, heavily metaphoric writing that transparently reveals the writer's ego to the reader. In trying to impress, the writer ends up alienating the reader. Scanning intensely for maze-like sentence structures is a good way to spot this structurally. From a content perspective, look for multiple sentences stuffed with adjectives strung together. If you suspect a passage is going purple, first rigorously interrogate whether a metaphor adds value. If so, try to carve it down to the essence of what's helpful about the metaphor, and keep only that.

## Good Voice and Flow

We've covered a lot of bad patterns to avoid. Here is the positive vision of what should be present instead in writing with a strong flow and compelling voice:

- Clear and direct, active, taking responsibility
- The topic is the focus, not the writer, the reader, or the relationship between the writer and reader
- Vivid verb choices instead of overusing adverbs with bland verbs
- Original, helpful metaphors when they help illuminate a concept from a different, important angle
- Adjectives are evocative and precise, they are splashed in carefully, not stacked up sentence after sentence into purple prose like the previous point
- Minimal jargon, particularly unnecessary non-technical jargon and business cliches
- Varied rhythm that builds and resolves tension
- A satisfying flow when read aloud
