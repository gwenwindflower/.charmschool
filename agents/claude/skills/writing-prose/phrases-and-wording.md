# Phrases and Wording

## Avoid - Tier 1

These should be judged aggressively. They can be used sparingly, writing would sound unnatural if they were completely eliminated, but they rarely add value, and are often red flags for deeper issues in overall voice.

### Throat-Clearing Openers

State content directly, remove phrases like:

- "Here's the thing:"
- "The uncomfortable truth is"
- "It turns out"
- "The real [X] is"
- "Let me be clear"
- "The truth is,"
- "I'll say it again:"
- "I'm going to be honest"
- "Can we talk about"
- "Here's what I find interesting"
- "Here's the problem though"

### Emphasis

#### Emphasis Cliches

- "Full stop." / "Period."
- "Let that sink in."
- "This matters because"
- "Make no mistake"
- "Here's why that matters"

#### Emphasis Filler and Adverbs

- "Really"
- "Very"
- "Pretty"
- "So"
- "Just"
- "Quite"
- "Surely"
- "Of course"

**Examples**:

- "That's just so tedious." → "That's tedious."
- "Really very exciting to hear." → "Exciting to hear."
- "This new feature is so cool!" -> "This is a much better developer experience."
- "This can be quite frustrating." → "This is frustrating."
- "This is pretty great." -> "This is great."
- "Surely we can do better than this." → "We can do better than this."
- "This is, of course, a significant improvement." → "This is a significant improvement."
- "I was genuinely delighted by this." -> "This is delightful."
- "Truly great work here." -> "Great work here."
- "This is merely a first step." → "This is a first step."

Emphasizing adverbs can be helpful when applied to specific details, particularly those that correspond to amounts or degrees. "Great work here, the button animation is really smooth." is a good usage of emphasis, because it highlights what was uniquely great about the work: the button animation being smoother than expected. Conversely, when they're applied to broad feelings, you can be confident they should be cut: "really quite fantastic" is a hard remove.

## Filler

### Phrases

- "At its core"
- "In today's X"
- "It's worth noting"
- "Importantly,"
- "At the end of the day"
- "When it comes to"
- "In a world where"
- "The reality is"

### Adverbs

- "Truly"
- "Deeply"
- "Ultimately"
- "Literally"
- "Genuinely"
- "Simply"
- "Merely"
- "Inherently"
- "Essentially"
- "Interestingly"

## Avoid - Tier 2

There are more situations where these can be appropriate, but they should still be scrutinized.

### Filler

#### Adverbs

- "Crucially"
- "Inevitably"
- "Fundamentally" / "Foundationally"

These can be warranted if you are discussing, for example, the foundational technology underlying a social movement (foundationally), or an element that a tool will not operate without (crucially). When they get applied to give legitimacy to a point, they should be cut: "Crucially, building this with TypeScript will allow us to catch bugs earlier." → "Building this with TypeScript will allow us to catch bugs earlier." If you need to clarify why catching bugs earlier is important to your organization, or why a reader should consider that crucial, that's a separate sentence.

### Absolutes

- "Everybody"
- "Always"
- "Never"
- "Everywhere"

For example: "Everywhere you go, everybody's talking about X" should be "A lot of my colleagues have praised the effectiveness of X".

There a plenty of situations where these are warranted, it's hyperbolic usage for emphasis that we want to eliminate.

### Jargon

Replace with plain language.

| Avoid | Use instead |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Game-changer | Significant, important |
| Double down | Commit, increase |
| Circle back | Return to, revisit |
| On the same page | Aligned, agreed |

Sports, gambling, and war metaphors - or jargon from these domains - are prevalent in modern business writing, but they are melodramatic cliches, and alienate many readers. They are a good signal that you should try digging for a more original, effective metaphor, or just describing the situation directly.

Technical jargon is fine in technical writing, but do not use tech jargon cliches in general prose. "X is a feature, not a bug" is a tired phrase unless you're literally describing a software limitation that has unexpected benefits.

## Telling Instead of Showing

Announcing difficulty or significance rather than demonstrating it, "actually", "genuinely", and "truly" are often red flags here:

- "This is genuinely hard"
- "This is what leadership actually looks like"
- "This is what X actually looks like"
- "Actually, this is a really significant improvement"
- "This is truly a game-changer for Y"

## Tired Cliches

- "Sing the praises of"
  - "Many people sing the prises of X" → "People speak highly of X for Y reason."
- "Seen the light"
  - "I've finally seen the light on goroutines." → "I now understand the value of goroutines."
- "Welcome to X"
  - "Generative AI is now in your doctor's office. Welcome to the future of healthcare." → "Generative AI is now in your doctor's office. This is a significant development for healthcare."
- Stating the year: "Why are we still doing X in 2026?" -> "The problem of X has persisted for decades. The emergence of Y presents an opportunity to finally address it."
- "X will never be the same"
  - "Generative AI is now in your doctor's office. Healthcare will never be the same." → "Generative AI is now in your doctor's office. This is a dramatic shift for healthcare, and experts are concerned that privacy is being traded away for convenience."
- "Wake up, X is here"
