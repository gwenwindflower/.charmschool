# Programming Language Tools README

Mise-en-place (`mise`) is used to manage all language-related tools. This simplifies the varied polyglot toolchains I move between - Go, Python, Rust, Deno, Bun, Node.js, etc. Mise gives us a single, fast, straightforward interface for all language-specific tasks and tools.

I'm relatively new to `mise`, so expect this to be under heavy updates for a while.
